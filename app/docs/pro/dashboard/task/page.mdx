# Tasks Tab

### Overview

The **Tasks** tab allows you to view a more granular list of your submitted tasks, filterable by **status, project, and batch**.

## Task Filters

You can search through your tasks using the following filters:

import { AlertTriangle } from "lucide-react";

> <AlertTriangle className="text-yellow-500" /> It is possible your task filters
> will hide all tasks. Please check your task filters carefully!

### 1. Creation Date Range

- Select the task completion or creation date range.

> **Note:** You are able to select **UTC Time, Pacific Time, or Local Time**.

### 2. Task Status

You can also filter based on the task status. Here are the following status options:

- **Completed** - Tasks that have been completed by our taskers.
- **In Progress** - Tasks that are being worked on by our taskers.
- **Queued** - Tasks that have not been worked on yet.
- **Error** - Tasks that have errors.
- **Canceled** - Tasks that have been cancelled by our customers.
- **Redo** - Tasks that have been re-done by Skala.

### 3. Audit Status

Filter based on the customer audit status:

- **Ready to Audit** - Tasks that have not been audited yet.
- **Accepted**
- **Fixed**
- **Rejected**

### In Progress vs. Queued

> You can only **cancel** tasks that are **Queued**.
>
> Once the status of a task has moved into **In Progress**, that means the task is already being worked on and can no longer be canceled.

## Audit Tasks

To audit tasks, click on an individual task and then click the **"Audit Tasks"** button. In this view you can:

- **Accept** - Signals that we have completed the task to your quality standards.
- **Fix** - If you want to make an immediate update to your callback response, you can fix tasks directly. Previous responses will be saved in the **prior_response** field of the callback body, and the **response** field will be updated with the new response.
- **Reject** - Signals that we have not met your quality standards.

To learn more about this workflow, please see our **[best practices here](#)**.

## Cancel Tasks

- You can only cancel tasks via the **API** - learn more about this endpoint **[here](#)**.
- You can only cancel tasks that are **Queued**.
- **Do not cancel tasks that are In Progress.** These tasks are already being worked on. Cancelling them may result in charges to compensate for the existing work.
