# **Manage Your Account**

## **Overview**

The **Skala platform** allows teams to efficiently manage their account settings, including **adding new users, modifying user roles, and configuring team defaults**. These actions can be accessed via the **Your Team** link in the top right corner of the dashboard.

## **Adding New Users**

To invite a new team member:

1. Scroll to the **Invite Member** button at the bottom of the page.
2. Enter the **email address** of the user you want to invite.
3. Skala will send an **email invitation** to the specified user.

Once invited, the user will appear as **Invited** in your team list. Refresh the page to verify the status.

### **Re-sending an Invitation**

If an invited user has not accepted, you can **remove the pending invitation** and re-invite them by clicking **Remove**, then selecting **Invite Member** again.

### **User Registration Process**

When a user accepts the invitation, they will be prompted to provide their **name, company information, and other profile details** before joining the team.

---

> 💡 **Good to Know!**  
> Users must accept your invite to join your team. Once an account is created, it **cannot be transferred** to another team.
>
> If a user **accidentally creates a new account** instead of accepting an invite, please email [support@skala.xyz](mailto:support@skala.xyz) so we can assist in moving them to your team.

---

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> A user **cannot** be added to multiple teams under the same account.
>
> If a user needs access to multiple Skala organizations, a best practice is to use **email aliases**.
>
> **Example:**
>
> - `joe.schmoe@skala.xyz` (for Team A)
> - `joe.schmoe+second@skala.xyz` (for Team B)
>
> Most email providers **ignore anything after the "+"** symbol, so the user will still receive all emails in the same inbox.

## **User Roles & Permissions**

Each team member can be assigned one of the following roles:

- **Member** – Can view and audit all tasks, create projects, and edit existing projects.
- **Manager** – Has all **Member** privileges plus the ability to **manage team members, retrieve API keys, and access billing information**.
- **Admin** – Each team can have only **one Admin**. Admins oversee **all projects, team members, API keys, and billing**. If an admin change is required, please contact **support@skala.xyz**.

---

## **Team Details**

In addition to managing users, you can also **modify team settings**, including:

- **Team Name** – Used as the prefix for project names.
- **Callback URL** – If a `callback_url` is not provided in an API request, the **default team callback URL** will be used.

## **API Keys Management**

To retrieve your **API keys**, navigate to the **API Keys** section under your user profile in the top right corner of the dashboard.

Within this section, you can:

- **Generate a new API key**.
- **Delete an existing API key** if it is no longer needed.

Skala provides two types of **API keys**:

- **Live API Key** – Used for **submitting real tasks** to the labeling team.
- **Test API Key** – Allows **testing API interactions** without submitting actual tasks.

For **secure callback authentication**, Skala includes a **`skala-callback-auth` HTTP header** in all callback responses. The value of this header will match the **Live Callback Auth Key** found on your dashboard. If the header is missing or incorrect, the callback is not from Skala.

To update payment details, go to the **Teams** section under your user profile.
