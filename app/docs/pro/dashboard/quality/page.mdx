> ##### ✅ **Why should you audit tasks?**
>
> Auditing tasks allows you to provide feedback directly to our taskers. This will help us identify common errors or clarify edge cases.

##### Auditing Workflow

There are three ways to audit tasks:

- **Audit completed tasks individually**
- **Audit all completed tasks within a date range**
- **Audit all tasks completed across a specific week**

##### How to audit completed tasks individually:

1. In the **Tasks** tab, filter on the **Completed** tasks.
2. Search for the task that you want to audit and click on **"Audit Task"**.

##### How to audit all completed tasks within a date range:

1. In the **Quality** tab, select the specified task date range, audit, or batch status.
2. Click on the **"Audit Tasks"** button - this will allow you to audit a random sample of tasks.

> ✅ **Auditing Tasks**
>
> If multiple team members are auditing at the same time, we will **lock** each task so that only one person can audit a task at a time. This prevents conflicted copies.

##### Audit Feedback

Within the audit workflow, you are able to make the following selections:

- **Approve** - Mark that tasks have been completed according to instructions.
- **Make Changes** - Fix tasks that have minor or non-critical errors and update your callback response immediately.
- **Reject** - Signal that tasks were completed incorrectly. Please provide detailed comments on how our team can improve.

> ✅ **Reject vs. Make Changes**
>
> - Both **Reject** and **Make Changes** will provide feedback to the Skala team about the quality of your tasks.
> - For quick or minor changes, please **Make Changes** as you will get an updated callback response right away. In addition, not all rejected tasks will be resubmitted. Please contact your engagement manager if you want to discuss re-dos
> - For critical and more structural misunderstanding of the instructions, please **Reject** the task and provide detailed feedback! This will help our taskers to improve.

## Audit Reports

The **quality assurance dashboard** displays total reviews, accepts, and rejects using filtered tasks. Additional reports include:

- **Tasks completed last week** - Audit tasks aggregated by completion date (Monday 00:00 to Sunday 23:59 PST, last 4 weeks).
- **Task Level Report** - List of tasks with auditor and completion time.
- **Auditor Tracker** - Audit report for tasks in batches.
- **Auditor Quality** - Summary of reviews, accepts, and rejects per auditor.

> **Note:** The **Auditor Tracker** is available only if you use batches.

## Callback Body

When an audit is submitted, the callback body will include:

- **customer_review_status**: "Accepted", "Rejected", or "Fixed".
- **customer_review_comments**: Comments left during the audit.
- **prior_responses**: Previous responses before the audit.

If a task is fixed through multiple audits:

- **response**: Updated with the most recent audit.
- **customer_review_status**: Reflects the most recent audit.
- **customer_review_comments**: Appends new comments.
- **prior_responses**: Appends previous responses.
