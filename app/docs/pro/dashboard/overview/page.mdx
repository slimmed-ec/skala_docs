### Batches

Batches are a way for you to organize tasks within a project. You can assign custom names for your batches. Our customers use batches to organize their tasks based on **location, date,** or any other types of metadata.

The **Overview** tab shows all of your batches and the **completion progress bar** over a specific task creation or task completion time period.
