# Downloading Data

To retrieve your data from Skala, navigate to the **"Deliveries"** tab in the dashboard, or use the **Skala API**.

Once you have selected your preferred method and found the Skala tasks you want to download, review the **callback format** to understand the meaning of each response field. Each task type has its own callback format. For example, the response format for **Image Annotation with Polygons** or **2D segmentation** is different.

### Option 1: Skala API - Listing Multiple Tasks

Our **API docs** provide support for listing multiple tasks.

### Option 2: Python SDK

If you're working with **Python**, we highly recommend leveraging our **Python SDK**.

The specific function used with the Python SDK is the **"List Tasks"** function.

### Option 3: Sail SDK

**Sail** is a data pipeline starter kit. The `task_download.py` script in the **Sail SDK** can be used for downloading all tasks from a project.
