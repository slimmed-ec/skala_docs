# Key Concepts & Definitions

To get high-quality ground truth data with Skala, your first step is to **create a project**. Within a project, you will upload data and create **tasks**, which are individual pieces of data to be labeled. Tasks can be grouped into **batches** to be launched for labeling. Every task will follow the same taxonomy defined at the project level.

Once your data is hosted in a way that Skala can access it, you can use our UI or submit an API call to create tasks. After launching a batch of tasks for labeling, their statuses will initially be marked as **"pending."**

**Skala Pro** customers can expect to receive tasks back according to the delivery schedule we have aligned with you. We support extremely high and dynamic volumes customized to your needs.

Once a task has been labeled, the task status will change to **"completed"** and a JSON response will be associated with it. This response can be downloaded via our platform.

Inside the web application, you can download a task's response individually or perform a bulk export over a filterable range of tasks. We also provide APIs to programmatically retrieve tasks by ID or list tasks based on customizable filter criteria. Additionally, we support **callbacks**, which allow for programmatic access to labeled data as tasks move to "completed" or "error" status.

## Task

A **task** represents an individual unit of work to be completed. There is a one-to-one mapping between a task and the data to be labeled.

For example, there is one task for each image, video, or piece of text to be labeled. Each task has a unique Skala-generated ID.

To create a task using our API, refer to our [API Reference](#).

## Project

A **project** organizes similar tasks based on instructions and the use case. All tasks within a project share the same instructions and annotation rules.

Key Details:

- A project is tied to one specific annotation use case, associated with a task type in the API reference.
- Multiple projects can be created for different use cases.

**Example:**

- One project could be for categorizing scenes.
- Another project could be for annotating images.

Every task is explicitly tied to a project to keep things organized. To create a project using our API, refer to our [API Reference](#).

## Batch

For **Skala Pro**, batches can optionally be used in high-volume projects to divide work within a project.

**Use Cases for Batches:**

- Tying tasks to specific internal datasets.
- Organizing tasks based on weekly submissions.

To create and launch a batch, refer to our [API Reference](#).

## Taxonomy

A **taxonomy** is a collection of labels and information associated with those labels, defined at the project level. Each label is referred to as an **annotation**.

Available annotation types include:

- Box
- Polygon
- Point
- Ellipse
- Cuboid
- Event
- Text response
- List selection
- Tree selection
- Date
- Linear scale
- Ranking

### Components of a Taxonomy:

1. **Annotation Classes**: Different types of an annotation.
2. **Global Attributes**: Information about the entire task.
3. **Annotation Attributes**: Information associated with a specific annotation.
4. **Link Attributes**: Relationships between two annotations.

### Example:

**Use Case**:

- Draw boxes around all cats and dogs in an image.
- Indicate the total number of cats and dogs in the image.
- Specify if each cat is sleeping or not.
- Indicate which cat each dog is looking at (if applicable).

**Taxonomy Design**:

1. Create two classes of box annotations:
   - One for "cat."
   - One for "dog."
2. Within the **cat** class:
   - Define an annotation attribute: "Sleeping or Not Sleeping."
3. Within the **dog** class:
   - Define a link attribute to relate a "dog" box to a "cat" box and indicate a "looking at" relationship.
4. Define a global attribute:
   - Ask the labeler to indicate the total number of cats and dogs in the image.

This taxonomy ensures clear relationships and precise labeling requirements for your use case.
