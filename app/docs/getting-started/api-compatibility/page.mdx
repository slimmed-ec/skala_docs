# **API Compatibility Policy**

The **Skala REST API** follows a structured **versioning system** to ensure seamless integration and long-term compatibility. The API is versioned via a **prefix in the URL**, with the current supported version being:

```
https://api.skala.xyz/v1/
```

Within a major API version (e.g., **v1**), we strive to **maintain backward compatibility**, ensuring that existing integrations continue to function without disruption. Any breaking changes will only be introduced in a **new API version** (e.g., **v2**).

---

## **🔹 Backward-Compatible Changes**

Backward-compatible changes are modifications that **do not break existing integrations** and may include:

✅ **Enhanced Request Handling**

- Adding new **optional** request parameters or HTTP headers.
- Making a previously required parameter **optional**.

✅ **Improved Input Validation**

- Rejecting improperly formatted requests that were previously accepted due to **improved validation and parsing**.

✅ **Expanded Response Data**

- Adding **new fields** to API responses or callback objects.
- Introducing **new enumerated values** for existing request parameters.

⚠️ **Note:** Any **undocumented functionality** may be modified or removed at any time without prior notice.

---

## **🔹 Backward-Incompatible Changes**

Breaking changes will only occur in a **new API version** (e.g., moving from `v1` to `v2`). These include:

❌ **Modifications to Existing Request Parameters**

- Changing the behavior of current request parameters.
- Renaming request parameters used in **POST** or **PUT** operations.
- Adding new **required** request parameters.

❌ **Changes to Response Data**

- Modifying the **meaning or type** of an existing response or callback field.
- Altering the semantics of enumerated values.

❌ **Structural API Modifications**

- Modifying the structure of an API route or changing its **expected behavior**.

To **ensure a smooth transition**, any breaking changes will be **introduced in a new API version**, allowing developers to migrate at their own pace.

---

## **🔹 API Deprecation Policy**

As the API evolves, certain features or endpoints may become deprecated. In such cases, we will:

🔹 **Proactively notify affected users** to ensure they have ample time to transition.  
🔹 **Provide continued support** for deprecated features during a migration period.  
🔹 **Offer migration guidance** to help developers transition smoothly to newer API versions.

We are committed to maintaining **stability, reliability, and transparency** in our API lifecycle. If you have any questions about API changes, reach out to our **support team**.
