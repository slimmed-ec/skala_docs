# API Compatibility Policy

The Skala REST API is versioned via a prefix in the URL. Currently, we only support v1 of the API via https://api.skala.xyz/v1/. Within an API version, we strive to only make backward-compatible changes to the API. This means that a client that integrates with v1 of our REST API will continue to work when querying v1 in the future.

## Backward-compatible changes

Backward-compatible changes can be made within an API version, and include:

- Adding new optional request parameters or HTTP request headers.

- Making a required request parameter optional.

- Rejecting a request which contains invalid parameter values, as a result of improved parsing and validation. Improperly formed requests that were previously accepted may be later rejected.

- Adding new fields to a response or callback object.

- Adding new values for existing parameters that have enumerated sets of values.

- Undocumented functionality may be removed or changed at any time.

## Backward-incompatible changes

Backward-incompatible changes will only happen in a new version of the API, and include:

- Changing the behavior of existing request parameters.

- Changing the names of elements used in API POST or PUT requests.

- Adding a new required request parameter.

- Changing the meaning of parameters that have enumerated values, or the meanings of those parameter values.

- Changing the meaning or type of existing response or callback fields.

- Changing the meaning of an API route.

## Deprecation policy

At times, we will deprecate and remove parts of our API that can no longer be supported. In this case, we will make a best effort to identify and notify affected users, and will continue to support the deprecated API during the migration process.
