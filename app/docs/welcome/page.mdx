# Getting Started with Skala

Guides and quickstarts for integrating Skala products.

Skala AI's mission is to accelerate the development of AI applications. To enable teams to make faster progress, we began with data - the foundation of all AI applications. Skala AI turns raw data into high-quality training data by combining machine learning-powered pre-labeling and active tooling with varying levels and types of human review.
