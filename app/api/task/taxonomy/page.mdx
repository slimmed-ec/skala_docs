# **🚀 Overview: Skala Taxonomy Service**

The **Taxonomy Service** is a powerful, **self-service tool** designed to help teams **effortlessly create, update, and manage taxonomies**. With its **intuitive version management system**, users can seamlessly track changes, maintain consistency across multiple taxonomy versions, and ensure their data remains properly labeled and structured.

Whether you're handling **simple annotations** or **complex tasks like LiDAR segmentation**, the Taxonomy Service automates the management process, reducing manual workload and improving **accuracy, efficiency, and scalability**. From **data labeling** to **final version tracking**, this service ensures **error-free workflow execution** while maintaining **high operational standards**.

## **🔹 Supported Task Types**

The **Taxonomy Service** currently supports the following task types:

✅ **Image & Video Annotation:**

- **SegmentAnnotation**
- **VideoAnnotation**
- **ImageAnnotation**

✅ **LiDAR-Based Tasks:**

- **LidarAnnotation**
- **LidarTopDown**
- **LidarLinking**
- **LidarSegmentation**

✅ **Sensor Fusion:**

- **SensorFusion**

Each task type is seamlessly integrated with the **Taxonomy Service**, ensuring smooth **annotation tracking, version control, and workflow automation**.

## **🔹 Taxonomy SRN (Service Resource Name)**

A **Taxonomy SRN** is a **unique identifier** assigned to each taxonomy version. It allows teams to **compare, track, and manage different taxonomy versions** across projects, ensuring **standardization and accuracy** throughout the labeling process.

### **📌 SRN Format:**

```
srn:skala:avcv:taxonomy:taxonomy:<projectId>/<name>/<version>/<hash>
```

### **📌 Example:**

```
srn:skala:avcv:taxonomy:taxonomy:654dd0785yytd22829f342hs/user_myproject_lidar_test/v1/0ac7578c6b32107816e071aa11353bab61bb6h1f
```

With this system, every taxonomy version remains **easily referenceable and comparable**, minimizing mislabeling risks.

---

## **🔹 Task Creation Process**

When the **Taxonomy Service** is enabled in your project, all **newly created tasks** will automatically inherit the **latest published taxonomy version**. This eliminates the need to manually include taxonomy JSON during task creation.

> **⚠️ Important:**  
> If you **manually include taxonomy JSON** in a task creation API call, it will **override** the taxonomy published via the **Taxonomy Service**. To ensure consistency, remove taxonomy JSON from the API request unless an override is explicitly required.

---

## **🔹 Managing Dependent Tasks & Projects**

For projects with **dependent tasks**, each **dependent project** must define its **own taxonomy** within the **Taxonomy Service**.

### **📌 Example Scenario:**

If you manage a **LidarAnnotation** project with dependent **LidarLinking** and **LidarTopDown** projects, each project must have its taxonomy **independently defined** in **Teddy**.

The **Taxonomy Service** automatically synchronizes taxonomies across dependent projects, ensuring that:  
✅ Each **dependent project** has its **own version-controlled taxonomy**.  
✅ Redundant **taxonomy parameters** in scripts and task definitions are eliminated.  
✅ Consistency is **maintained across multiple AI labeling workflows**.

---

## **🔹 Tracking & Monitoring Taxonomies**

The **Taxonomy Metrics Tool** provides real-time visibility into taxonomy usage across tasks.

### **📌 How to Track Taxonomies:**

1️⃣ Navigate to the **Taxonomy Metrics** dashboard.  
2️⃣ Monitor **where** and **how** taxonomies & policies were applied.  
3️⃣ Track **batches and task status** to gain insights into **progress & performance**.  
4️⃣ Identify **potential issues** early and ensure taxonomy consistency across labeling projects.

By leveraging **Taxonomy Metrics**, teams can enhance **workflow transparency, improve labeling accuracy, and maintain full auditability of dataset versions**.
