# Overview

The Taxonomy Service is an intuitive, self-service tool designed to help teams efficiently create, update, and manage taxonomies. With its streamlined version management feature, users can easily track changes and ensure consistency across multiple versions of taxonomy-related tasks. By providing a unique identifier for each taxonomy, this tool guarantees that your data is always properly labeled and organized.

Whether you're managing simple annotations or complex tasks like Lidar segmentation, the Taxonomy Service simplifies the process, so you can focus more on accuracy and less on manual management. It ensures that every step in your workflow, from data labeling to final version tracking, is handled seamlessly, reducing errors and maintaining high standards across your operations.

## Supported Task Types

Currently, Taxonomy Service supports the following task types:

- Segment Annotation
- LidarAnnotation
- Lidar TopDown
- LidarLinking
- LidarSegmentation
- VideoAnnotation
- ImageAnnotation
- Sensor Fusion

## Taxonomy SRN

A Taxonomy SRN (Service Resource Name) is a unique identifier for a specific taxonomy version. It allows you to compare and track different versions of taxonomies across tasks ensuring consistency and accuracy for your labeling requirements.

### Format

```
srn:skala:avcv:taxonomy:taxonomy:<projectId>/<name>/<version>/<hash>
```

### Example

```
srn:skala:avcv:taxonomy:taxonomy:654dd0785yytd22829f342hs/user_myproject_lidar_test/v1/0ac7578c6b32107816e071aa11353bab61bb6h1f
```

## Task Creation Process

When Taxonomy Service is enabled on your project, tasks that are created will automatically be updated with the latest taxonomy that was published using Taxonomy Service. Therefore, you can remove taxonomy JSON during the task creation process.

> **Note:** If you keep the taxonomy JSON in the task creation API call, the taxonomy JSON will override any taxonomy published using Taxonomy Service.

## Dependent Tasks

Each dependent project must have its own taxonomy defined in Taxonomy Service. For example, if you have a LidarAnnotation project and dependent LidarLinking and LidarTopDown projects, each must have its taxonomy defined separately in Teddy.

### Dependent Projects

Taxonomy Service supports dependent projects, managing their taxonomies automatically. Ensure each project is set up with its own taxonomy, and remove any taxonomy-related parameters from the scripts and task parameters.

## Tracking

Use the Taxonomy Metrics tool to review and monitor where the Taxonomies and policies were applied.

Once you are on the **Taxonomy Metrics** page, you can track the batches and the status for these tasks, understanding the progress as well as the work done for them.
