# Create Sensor Fusion Tasks

[**Recommended**] We recommend using this SDK documentation to create Sensor Fusion tasks.

This endpoint creates a **sensorfusion task**. In this task, annotators load the sensor fusion scene and apply various annotations to mark objects or segment the point cloud. Sensor fusion scenes may contain **3D point clouds** (from LiDARs, radars, and/or point sensors) and **2D images/videos** (from camera sensors). Supported annotations include:

- 3D cuboids
- Point cloud segmentation
- 3D keypoints
- Top-down polygons

## Body Parameters

### **`attachments`** _(array of strings, required)_

List of URLs to the Sensor Fusion Scene objects you'd like to be labeled.

> **Note**: For sensor fusion tasks, there must only be one URL provided.

---

### **`scene_format`** _(string, required)_

The format of the scene provided.

> Currently, only supports `sensor_fusion`.

---

### **`project`** _(string, required)_

The name of the project to associate this task with.

---

### **`instruction`** _(string, required)_

A markdown-enabled string or iframe-embedded Google Doc explaining how to do the task.  
You can use markdown to:

- Show example images
- Structure your instructions
- Provide clarity for the annotators

---

### **`annotation_definition`** _(array of objects, required)_

List of annotation definitions to use for labeling.

---

### **`callback_url`** _(string, required)_

The full URL (including the scheme `http://` or `https://`) that will be used for the callback when the task is completed.

---

### **`unique_id`** _(object)_

An arbitrary ID that you can assign to a task and query for later.

> **Note**: This ID must be unique across all projects under your account. If it is not unique, the task submission will be rejected. See [Avoiding Duplicate Tasks](#avoiding-duplicate-tasks) for more details.

---

### **`clear_unique_id_on_error`** _(boolean)_

If set to `true`, the `unique_id` on the task will be unset if the task errors out after being submitted.  
This allows workflows where you can re-submit the same `unique_id` to recover from errors automatically.

---

### **`is_frameless`** _(boolean, required)_

Specifies whether to label as a frameless task.

---

### **`tags`** _(array of strings)_

Arbitrary labels that you can assign to a task.  
**Constraints**:

- At most 5 tags are allowed per task.
- You can query tasks with specific tags using the task retrieval API.

```python filename="sensorfusion_task.py"
import requests

url = "https://api.skala.xyz/v1/task/sensorfusion"

payload = {
    "scene_format": "\"sensor_fusion\"",
    "instruction": "**Instructions:** Please label all the things",
    "callback_url": "https://example.com/callback"
}
headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
