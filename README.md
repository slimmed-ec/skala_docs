## What is SKALA AI?

SKALA AI is an AI-powered engine designed to label and annotate data for machine learning and AI applications. It supports multiple data types, with a current focus on image labeling. Other data types are under development.

### Key Features:

1. **AI Engine for Data Labeling**: Automates the process of labeling data for training machine learning models.
2. **Supported Data Types**:
   - 3D Images
   - 2D Images (e.g., invoices, bills)
   - Maps
   - Text (e.g., email bodies)
   - Audio (coming soon)
3. **Human-in-the-Loop Learning**: SKALA AI improves over time using **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**, leveraging contributions from the community via the [SKALA Play App](https://skala.xyz/play).
4. **Corporate Use**: SKALA AI is a required tool for corporate users to label their data efficiently.
5. **Open Framework**: The labeling framework is available on GitHub for customization and integration.
